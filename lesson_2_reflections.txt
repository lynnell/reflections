git init
When you initialize the repository, Git doesn't create any commits for you. You have to create the first commit yourself. 

Why would you NOT want Git to do the first commit automatically?  Two reasons - 1. you may not want to commit everything in the respository
 2. you wouldn't be able to put your own comments in the commit message. 

 Staging Area contains files added, but not yet committed. 

 git commit

 git commit -m "Commit message goes here"
